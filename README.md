This started as a competition to see where AI was at with a novel programming task. The challenge was to find the word that best represented a license plate. A good license plate word should start with the first letter, be short, and have as few as possible addtional consonants other than q. A License plate starts with three random consonants excluding q. An example would for "SWM" would be "swim". I have a test from 1.5 years ago and from a modern LLM. They write good syntax but are horribly inefficient. The older one needed many rewrites for valid code. I live in Texas where we don't use q.
